# Project 1 Overview: Predicting Customer Churn?
* This was an educational project

* It is cheaper to retain customers than aquire them. Just like any business, banks wish to limit customer exits (the churn) by predicting who is at risk. 
* Goal: Answer the question: can we predict who is likely to leave the bank using logistic regression?
* Data: 10,000 customer accounts defined by 11 variables. Split into training and testing.  Outcome variable is binary: true if customer leaves bank.
* Analysis: Frequencies in catagorical variables checked. Some variables transformed and variable correlations checked.
* Model: Outcome variable of interest is binary. Backwards elimination is used. Interactions explored. Influence/leverage points checked. Model significance checked.
* Prediction outcomes: Model correctly predicts a customer will leave 34% of the time. The overall accuracy is 84%. Model fails due to Type II error.
